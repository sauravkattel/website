  <h2 id="sherpa">Sherpa Village</h2>
  <p id="secondparagraph"> Passing through <span id="text">legendary Sherpa villages</span>, the trek is a mix of a deeply cultural and spiritual experience in addition to the physical one. <span id="text">Buddhist lamas, monks and nuns </span> led by Rinpoches (reincarnate lamas) serve the predominantly Sherpa com­munities from gompas (monasteries).<br>

The journey to Everest or Everest Base Camp, begins from <span id="text">Lukla</span>, if you are taking a direct flight from the capital. However, for die-hard lovers of trekking, there is an another switchback starting from <span id="text"> Jiri</span>through the mid-hills of Solu; ethnically diverse and flora-rich . </p>

The option from Jiri will roughly take 10 days to reach the famous Sherpa village,<span id="text"> Namche Bazaar (3,500m)</span>. The Sagarmatha National Park in the Khumbu is one of the few places on earth with the rarest bio-diversity and the highest and youngest mountain system in the world.  </p>

A part of the <span id="text"> Himalayan ecological zone</span>, the park was added to the list of UNESCO Natural World Heritage Sites in 1979.  The park contains <span id="text"> three of the world's seven highest mountains</span> Sagarmatha or Mt.
